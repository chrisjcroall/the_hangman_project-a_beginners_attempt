# the_hangman_project-a_beginners_attempt

A guessing game in which one player attempts to guess the letters of a word; failing attempts are recorded by drawing a gallows and someone hanging from it, line by line.

This is my very first coding school project using a combination of loops, if/else statements, inputs, emoji icons. Random select was inserted to randomize various selected words for every new attempt.

Contribution was made by WBS Coding School by running and checking correctness of the code used.

Enjoy.
